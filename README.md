# COVID_BBB_GSEA project

Investigating the impact of COVID infections on the blood-brain barrier using GSEA and GEO datasets.
GEO datasets used:
GSE167000 (Idnetification & Verification)
GSE179923 (Verification)

# Objective:
Explore gene expression changes at the blood-brain barrier in response to COVID infections.

# Methodology:
Performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) using datasets obtained from GEO.

# Key Findings:
Identified gene expression patterns indicative of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in COVID-infected individuals.

# Dependencies:
- Python 3
- R
- GSEA software

# Contributing:
